# `Todo list` build using Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Used [template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-vue-ts) to quickly start developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite.
Also added [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite) for making UI nice and clean.

# Project purposes

I started this just as a simple side project. Being [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) dev I was curious what is [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and how it differs from React, but I also wanted to play with `TypeScript` and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
I guess that was a good enough reason to start this project. Saying that it's a basic and extremely easy-to-use app. It reads from `localStorage` and defaults to some items for demo purposes. If you make changes to the list it will be reflected in stored value and thus on the next visit (or page reload), you will see your changes.

## Missing parts (aka todo)

1. add RWD capabilities (CSS / tailwind) - currently, it's not responsible at all
2. unit tests
